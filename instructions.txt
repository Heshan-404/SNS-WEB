this project about a commercial web app for a hardware item shop actullay a pipe selling cener website 

so there are products and each have these fields

 - product name 
 - product short name
 - desctription 
 - category
 - brand
 - one required image and 3 optional sub images
 - then some products may have available sizes [20 x 1/2' , 25 x 1/2' , 25 x 3/4' , 32 x 1']
 - then some products may be have votages [10W , 20W , 30W , 50W , 100W]
 - then some products may be have colors [D/L - W/W , D/L - BLUE]
 - use should be able to add these colors voltages sizes as tags just strings
 - also should be able to edit this created products if wanted like change brand, change name, chagne category, change product change description and change colors or voltages , sizes , images
 
but categories and brands should be already registered and then only can select these when creating a new product 
so when creating a category and brand user just have to enter the Cateogry name or brand name
so
 - should be able to create new categories
 - should be able to create new brands
 - should be able to rename brands and categoirs if needed and also delete if not that brand or category !!!not used in any product !!!

then there should be a authentication system to login to admin dashboard to manage these things



ok then in user perspective these things should be able to fetch to frontend 

- list all brands and categories to filter in filter menu
- fetch all products in pagination wise
- fetch products by categories or by brands or by cateogries & brands
- when showing products it just will show only main image and short name and brand and category in showcase menus
- but in view perticualy page need to fetch all data of that product 
   all 4 images if have 
   product name , brand , category , descrpiton , available sizes if have , voltages if have , colros if have

and there is a form in landing page to contact user with shop so its need an another api that will send email to shop owner there will take these details from the form

 - Name
 - Email (optional)
 - Phone No
 - Message


 user will select multiple categories and multiple brands in same time so api should be able to get all products in taht brands and   │
│    categoris may be user will just select more categories and may be more barnds or will both more catgoreis and brands
